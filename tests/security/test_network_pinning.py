"""Connection-time outbound enforcement.

Validating a hostname and then letting the HTTP client resolve it again leaves
a time-of-check/time-of-use window: a name that resolves to a public address
during validation can resolve to a private address when the socket opens. That
is DNS rebinding.

These tests cover the pinning behaviour and the encoding forms the roadmap
lists: IPv4 and IPv6 policy, IPv4-mapped IPv6, trailing-dot names, embedded
credentials, metadata hosts, and the rebinding race itself.
