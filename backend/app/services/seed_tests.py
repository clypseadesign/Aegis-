"""Seed a project with the bundled security test case library.

The YAML files under ``app/test_cases`` are the canonical attack library, but
nothing imports them into the database, so a freshly created project has no
tests and the execution engine cannot be used. This service bridges that gap by
converting the files into ``SecurityTest`` rows.

The conversion is deliberately thin: ``TestCase.to_config()`` already produces
the dict shape the execution engine reads, so the only work here is wrapping it
in a row and adding the ``category`` key that report generation relies on for
OWASP mapping.
