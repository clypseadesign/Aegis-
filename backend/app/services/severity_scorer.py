"""Automatic severity scoring for AegisAI findings.

Computes a severity from a finding's textual content (title, description,
and detail values) using keyword heuristics, independent of the grading
configuration. This acts as the default when a caller or classifier does
not supply an explicit severity.

Signals are ordered from most to least severe; the first tier with a
match wins. Matching is case-insensitive and whole-word (or whole
underscore/hyphen-delimited token) so that short signals such as ``pii``
or ``rce`` do not fire inside unrelated words.

The keyword lists are intentionally conservative: a term only appears
here when its presence in a security finding reliably implies that
severity tier. Ambiguous wording (for example "internal") is left out
rather than guessed at, and such findings fall through to ``MEDIUM``.
