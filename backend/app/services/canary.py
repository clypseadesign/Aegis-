"""Deterministic disclosure detection using planted canaries.

Keyword grading cannot tell "the model disclosed X" from "the model mentioned X
while refusing or explaining". That ambiguity is the source of most false
positives: a refusal that quotes the sensitive term is graded identically to a
successful extraction.

A canary removes the ambiguity entirely. AegisAI plants a unique, high-entropy
token in a turn it controls, then asks for it back. If the token reappears in
the response, disclosure is *proved* -- there is no interpretation left to make.
If it does not, nothing is inferred.

This is therefore a one-sided test: a positive is conclusive, a negative says
only that this particular probe did not leak. It never produces a false
positive, because the token is generated per execution and cannot appear by
accident.

What AegisAI can and cannot plant
----------------------------------
The canary lives in the conversation AegisAI itself constructs. It proves that a
model retained and disclosed context it was given in an earlier turn of the same
exchange.

It cannot plant a token in the customer's own production system prompt, their
vector store, or their tool outputs, because AegisAI does not own those. This
module therefore proves *context injection* and *turn-to-turn retention*
conclusively. Proving leakage of a customer's real production data needs either
their cooperation in planting a canary, or a judge. That boundary is deliberate
and is stated in ``docs/grading-accuracy.md``.
