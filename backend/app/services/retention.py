"""Evidence retention and deletion.

Evidence is the most sensitive data AegisAI holds: it contains the prompts
sent and the responses that produced a finding. Retention therefore has to be
finite and enforced, not merely documented.

Each project declares how long its evidence is kept. A cleanup pass removes
evidence rows and generated report artifacts that have aged past that window.

Deliberate limitation: deleting a file from a report volume is an unlink, not a
secure erase. On copy-on-write filesystems and SSDs the old blocks may persist.
Guaranteeing otherwise needs volume encryption with key destruction, which is a
deployment concern. See ``docs/data-retention.md``.
