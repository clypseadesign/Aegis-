"""Evidence persistence helpers for AegisAI executions.

Auto-persists request/response pairs as ``Evidence`` records linked to
the finding generated during an execution.

Content is scanned for sensitive values before it is written. A data-leakage
finding exists precisely because the model returned something sensitive, so
storing the response verbatim would accumulate the very secrets the assessment
discovered. Detected values are replaced with a keyed fingerprint, and the
record is classified so restricted evidence can be surfaced differently later.
