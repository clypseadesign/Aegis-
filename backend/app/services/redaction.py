"""Sensitive-data detection and redaction for stored evidence.

An assessment captures the exact prompts and responses it caused, which is the
product's value. It also frequently captures the very secrets it discovered:
a data-leakage finding exists precisely because the model returned something
sensitive. Persisting those responses verbatim would therefore turn AegisAI
into a place where leaked credentials quietly accumulate.

The compromise is that a detected secret is *replaced* by a placeholder that
carries a keyed fingerprint. The assessment can still prove that a specific
secret was disclosed, and can recognise the same secret appearing again in a
later run, without the value itself being at rest.

Detection is deliberately high-precision. A red-team tool that flagged ordinary
prose would be unusable, so patterns are anchored on formats that are unlikely
to occur by accident, and ambiguous short phrases are left alone.
