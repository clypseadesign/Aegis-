"""Outbound network policy and SSRF protection for AegisAI.

User-configured target endpoints are untrusted input. Before any outbound
target connection is established, the endpoint is parsed, its scheme is
validated, embedded credentials are rejected, the hostname is resolved, and
every resolved address is checked against an allow/deny policy.

Resolving and validating is not sufficient on its own. A name that resolves
to a public address during validation can resolve to a private address when
the connection is actually made, which is DNS rebinding. Validation alone
therefore leaves a time-of-check/time-of-use window.

The connection is pinned instead: the hostname is resolved once, every
address is checked, and the request is sent to one of the validated addresses
by IP literal. The original hostname is preserved in the ``Host`` header and
in TLS SNI, so virtual hosting and certificate validation still work, but the
socket can only ever be opened to an address that already passed policy.

Model adapters also disable automatic redirects, so policy cannot be bypassed
by redirection.
