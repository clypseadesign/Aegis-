"""add projects.evidence_retention_days

Evidence is the most sensitive data AegisAI holds. Retention was previously
unbounded, so a project accumulated evidence and generated artifacts forever.

The default is a bounded 90 days rather than "keep indefinitely" so that a
project cannot silently retain it without someone deciding to.

0 remains available for operators who arrange their own deletion.
